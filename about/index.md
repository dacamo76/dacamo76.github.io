This page will always be in a state of flux since I find writing about
myself rather difficult, the whole idea of having an about page sounds
pretentious.
Eventually I hope to have links to stuff that make me look much cooler
than I really am. Come to think of it, isn't that what a Facebook page is for?

Until then, [you'll get nothing and like it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLdBrx-ijwQ).

## Who are you?

I am the world's foremost expert on [Thomas & Friends](http://ttte.wikia.com/wiki/Thomas_%26_Friends). Seriously. Well, after my son that is.

When not watching talking steam engines,
I'm a computer scientist who develops data driven applications.
In true generalist fashion, I have shipped products in C, Java,
C#, Python, Clojure, and Ruby over the last 10 years.

Recently my interest lies in developing distributed data systems while dabbling
in functional programming languages and hypermedia APIs.

You can find my (relatively) up to date professional profile on
[LinkedIn](http:/linkedin.com/in/danielcanas).

## Free Time Stuff
* huh, what's this free time you speak of?
* Reading (Another section I should eventually add to this site)
* Soccer

## Contact Me

I'm on [twitter](http://twitter.com/dacamo76), mostly just an observer,
but it's the easiest way to get in touch.
